## 4. Exiting Cleaning Mode (Important)

### Default exit method
- **Press and hold the left mouse button for 5 seconds**
- You’ll see a countdown (e.g., 5 → 0)
- When it reaches zero, Cleaning Mode ends and normal control returns

### Tips
- Keep holding without releasing until the countdown completes
- If you’re using a trackpad, make sure the “left click / press” stays held continuously

---

## 5. Safer Cleaning Tips

- Use a soft microfiber cloth
- If you use a cleaning solution:
  - **Spray onto the cloth first**, not directly onto the screen
  - Avoid getting moisture near edges, ports, or the keyboard
- Wipe gently—don’t press hard on the panel

## 6. FAQ

### Q1: I held the left button—why didn’t it exit?
- Make sure you hold continuously for the full **5 seconds**
- Check whether the countdown is changing; if not, release and try again

### Q2: Does it completely lock all input system-wide?
- Screen Clean Mode is designed to **minimize accidental input** and provide a reliable, simple exit  
- A system-wide input lock typically requires higher privileges and may impact safety and review requirements, so this app uses a lightweight, user-friendly approach

### Q3: Do you collect any data?
- No. The app does not collect personal data, does not upload anything, and runs locally on your Mac.
